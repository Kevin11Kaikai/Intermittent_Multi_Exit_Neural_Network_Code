# Intermittent_Multi_Exit_Neural_Network_Code
Summary of the Work for the Project Intermittent Inference with Nonuniformly Compressed Multi-Exit Neural Network for Energy Harvesting Powered Devices. AMC+HAQ folder contains the code for Non-uniform Compression. The openmv folder contains the code for running the multi-exit neural network in the openmv board. Pruning,_Incremental,_Entropy,_Split_Modes,_Mult_exit_MNIST_Digits_on_TensorFlow_Lite_for_Microcontrollers.ipynb is the notebook to train the multi-exit neural network for MNIST Digits on Tensorflow_Lite. The main_multi_exit.py is to train and save the multi-exit neural network by Pytorch.
